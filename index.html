    <hr>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Pollution is a serious threat to our planet. Traditional energy sources like coal, gas, and carbon-based fuels
        are polluting our environment and harming not just us, but also the future generations. The world is already
        taking steps to fight pollution, and now it's our responsibility to contribute actively.Clean energy, especially
        solar energy, is the key to reducing pollution. Unlike coal or gas, solar power produces
        electricity without releasing harmful gases into the atmosphere.

        But there's a challenge: Solar energy is still expensive for many middle-class families. To make a real
        difference, solar energy must be affordable and accessible to everyone.</p>
